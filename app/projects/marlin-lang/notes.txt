Lexer -> Parser -> Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
    Lexer: Parses character stream into an Enum of tokens (identifiers, literals, operators, parenthesis, etc.)
    Parser: Parses token stream into an AST represenation

Compiler/Linker
    Segmented memory for data and code
    Visitor pattern to transform the AST into assembly instructions

Language features
    Arithmetic expressions and boolean operators
    Expression-oriented syntax - if statements, loops, and assignments can return values
    Control flow - while, for
    Arrays, pointers, structs
    Nested type resolution

Instruction set
    Integer and double precision arithmetic instructions with both immediate and register formats (ADD, SUB, MULT, DIV, AND, OR, XOR, ...)
    Load/store instrucions with both immediate value and register formats for memory access with special instructions
    Push/pop instructions to atomically increment stack pointer and store data
    Conditional branch (JMP), CALL, and RET
    PUTC/GETC for character I/O
