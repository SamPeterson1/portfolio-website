Functional description:
    Support position-based LED effects to be streamed/synchronized to multiple devices at once
    Integrate with outside events and music
    Provide a HTTP API for controlling effects and setting parameters

Networking:
    MDNS device discovery
    TCP socket to receive events
    UDP socket to stream RGB data to network devices

Web server:
    Uses axon web server framework
    Device registration, discovery, pairing, enable/disable devices
    Set effects, effect parameters, pause/resume 
    
Multithreaded architecture
    Each device is its own thread, consumes a stream of LED colors to send to devices
    One thread for the currently running effect - receives events and outputs a state that is used in a closure given to the device manager object
        The device manager  calls a shader closure with the positions of each discrete lighting element in the device, streams colors to each device thread

    Event sources are their own thread and send events to the effect controller

Current supported endpoint devices
    Nanoleaf shapes
    NeoPixel LED strips controlled using an ESP32
